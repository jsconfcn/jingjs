Description
-----------

YP.com is the largest Ruby shop in LA.  A few months ago we started migrating a large codebase from Ruby to Node.js.

Full-stack JavaScript app opens-up new possibilities but it also comes with a price of having to make many quick in-flight decisions: Which web framework to use if any? How to organize our client-side codebase? Should we write in Object Oriented or functional style? What's the best way to migrate big ball of mud into JavaScript poetry?

In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase.
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately to any JavaScript developer.

**Agenda (if time permits)**

* Web frameworks Fight! Express vs Hapi vs http.createServer
* Control Flow - Callbacks vs Promises
* Client side code - CommonJS vs AMD
* Code style - OO vs Functional
* Dealing with legacy code - Migration Strategy
* Error handling - Domains?
