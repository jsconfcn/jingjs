## Description

Code boilerplate is unruly to work with. It's often not as simple as copy-and-paste. There's custom components to be added (or not added) in, titles to changes, variables to modify, etc. This process of editting boilerplate is neither fun nor efficient. This is exactly how Yeoman can help. It takes the process of introducing boilerplate and automates it. It allows for templating, custom logic on pathing and which files to include or not to include and even automates the creation of unit tests. It also comes with baked-in support for Grunt.js, a tool you should be using if you aren't already. Come learn how to quickly scaffold projects with this hands-on presentation.
