This is a hands-on session and attendees will be able to code with me if they want to.

Every day on IRC someone new to Node is asking how to create a website and usually she is being directed to express.js, the most popular web framework in Node.
But as you get closer to the core Noders (Isaacs, Substack, Mikeal etc) you noticed that many of them don't use any framework to build their websites or web service. Where is this gap coming from? This session we'll reveal together the 'secrets' of building a website that follows the Unix Philosophy - small modules that works nicely with each other. After this session you'll have the foundations to create your own fast and lean website.

## Topics covered

* Routing
* Templates
* Serving static files
* Handling errors
