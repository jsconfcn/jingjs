Description
-----------

This is a hands-on session and attendees will be able to code if they want to.

Everyday someone new to Node is asking 'how to create a website' on the IRC and usually she is being directed to express.js, the most popular web framework in Node.
But as you get closer to the core Noder (Isaacs, Substack, Mikeal etc) you noticed that many of them don't use any framework to build their websites or web service. Where is this gap coming from? This session we'll reveal together the 'secrets' of building a website that follows the Unix philosophy - small modules that works nicely with each other. After this session you'll have the foundations for build your own website. Fast, Lean and approved by Substack (:
